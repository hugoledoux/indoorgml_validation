# A few IndoorGML datasets that can be publicly used

I used them for designing, developing, and testing my implementation in [val3dity](https://github.com/tudelft3d/val3dity) for validating IndoorGML files.

Each of the folders in `./datasets/` contain one dataset (.xml or .gml), `source.txt` gives details where it's taken from, and `report.json` is the val3dity report ([how to interpret it?](https://val3dity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-interpret-the-report)).

The `report.json` can be browsed at [http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity/browser/](http://geovalidation.bk.tudelft.nl/val3dity/browser/)
